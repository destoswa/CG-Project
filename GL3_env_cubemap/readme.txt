GL3 - Textures, reflections, and shadows

Task GL3.1: Texture
------------------------
Task GL3.1.1: Sampling a texture
	In this first part, the texture is sampled by using the function <texture2D>, which returns a 4D vector and by rescalling it into a 3Dd vector by dropping the
	last coordinate.

Task GL3.1.2: UV coordinates and wrapping modes
	Here, the texture is first reshaped by changing the vertex positions so that it takes only a fourth of the its original size and then the loading_option of the texture 	is set to <wrap: 'mirror'> in order to repeat the texture.

Task GL3.2: Environment mapping
------------------------
Task GL3.2.1: Projection matrix for a cube camera
	
	
Task GL3.2.2: Up vectors for cube camera
	
Task GL3.2.3: Reflection shader
	

Task GL3.3: Shadow Mapping
------------------------
Task GL3.3.1: Phong Lighting Shader with Shadows
	
Task GL3.3.2 Blend Options
